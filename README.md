# David Ben-Gurion Website
The website is about David Ben-Gurion, the primary national founder of the State of Israel and the
first prime minister of Israel.


On the website I describe the life of Ben-Gurion through a short summary of his history (about me section), historical photos of David Ben-Gurion with the Prime Minister of England, Winston Churchill, Golda Meir, Albert Einstein and more. In addition, I added favorite songs of David Ben-Gurion (Hatikva - the National Anthem) and songs that I thought David would have liked if he had been alive. In addition, there is an option to like my page, and like David's favorite Facebook page. The website can be entered with a barcode effectively. At the end of the site, you can send me an email for any questions, comments or criticisms about the site that I would be happy to receive.
